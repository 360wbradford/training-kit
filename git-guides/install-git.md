## Checking for Git

To see if you already have Git installed, open up your terminal application.

- If you're on a Mac, look for an appliction called "Terminal".
- If you're on a Windows machine, look for an application called "Git Bash". 

Once you've opened your terminal application, type `git version`. The output will either tell you which version of Git is installed, or it will alert you that `git` is an unknown command. If it's an unknown command, read further and find out how to install Git.

## GitHub Desktop

Regardless of if you have Git installed or not, GitHub Desktop offers a simple collaboration tool for Git. Installing GitHub Desktop also installs Git, if you don't already have it. You can [learn more here](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Install Git on Windows

[`git-scm`](https://git-scm.com/download/win) is the most recommended resource for downloading Git for Windows. The advantage of downloading Git from `git-scm` is that your download will include the recommended terminal, `Git Bash`. If you aren't sure which options to select during the install, we recommend keeping with the defaults.

## Install Git on Mac

Most versions of MacOS will already have `git` installed, and you can activate it through the terminal with `git version`. However, if you don't have Git installed for whatever reason, you can [download it here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
