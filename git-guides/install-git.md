## Checking for Git

To see if you already have Git installed, open up your terminal application.

- If you're on a Mac, look for a command prompt application called "Terminal".
- If you're on a Windows machine, open the windows command prompt or "Git Bash".

Once you've opened your terminal application, type `git version`. The output will either tell you which version of Git is installed, or it will alert you that `git` is an unknown command. If it's an unknown command, read further and find out how to install Git.

## GitHub Desktop

Regardless of if you have Git installed or not, GitHub Desktop offers a simple collaboration tool for Git. Installing GitHub Desktop also installs Git, if you don't already have it. You can [learn more here](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Install Git on Windows

1) Navigate to the latest [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/) and download the latest version.
2) Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the **Git Setup** wizard screen until the installation is complete.
3) Open the windows command prompt (or **Git Bash** if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command Prompt during the Git installation).
4) Type `git version` to verify Git was installed.

Note: [`git-scm`](https://git-scm.com/download/win) is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git for Windows. The advantage of downloading Git from `git-scm` is that your download automatically starts with the latest version of Git included with the recommended command prompt, `Git Bash` . The download source is the same [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/) as referenced in the steps above.

## Install Git on Mac

Most versions of MacOS will already have `git` installed, and you can activate it through the terminal with `git version`. However, if you don't have Git installed for whatever reason, you can [download it here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

## Install Git on Linux

Fun fact: Git was originally developed to version the Linux operating system! So, it only makes sense that it is easy to configure to run on Linux. You can download the proper Git versions and read more about how to install on specific Linux systems, like installing Git on Ubuntu, [in git-scm's documentation](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).
